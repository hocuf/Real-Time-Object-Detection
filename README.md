"# Real Time Object Detection" 

These codes are written for real-time object detection. The code reads frames from a real-time video stream using a computer camera. It then performs object detection using a library called cvlib and draws a frame around the detected objects. The code also processes the output, determining the types of objects and how reliable their detection is. Finally, it displays the object detection results in a window. If the "q" key is pressed, the process is terminated and the window is closed.
